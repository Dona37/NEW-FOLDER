            <strong>do not make any payment</strong> and report him/her

            On Internshala, jobs with CTC less than 2 LPA and unpaid internships
            are not allowed, unless explicitly mentioned so in the
            internship/job post. If you come across any such incident where the
            stipend/salary mentioned on Internshala and the offer letter do not
            match, do notify us.
          </div>
          <div class="body-main margin_top">
            There also might be a case where the employer might stop responding
            to you or refuse to pay you the promised salary/stipend or issue the
            certificate of completion, after you have performed the assigned
            work.

            Any assignment that an employer asks you to do should assess your
            suitability for the role, and should be relevant to the profile.

          <div class="body-main margin_top">
            Please report employers, if they asks you to do extremely lengthy
            assignments which may involve making business strategies for their
            company, writing multiple articles for their blog, promoting their
            social media accounts in your network, increasing downloads of their
            app, or designing multiple graphics for their company. These
            assignments may be a scheme by the company to get free work done.

            Be cautious of employers who ask for details like PIN, pan card,
            bank account, credit card, OTP, Aadhar, etc., via online channels,
            in exchange for a ‘special offer’. This may be a scammer trying to
            obtain your information to impersonate you.
          </div>
          <div class="body-main margin_top">
            Legitimate employers would have had sufficient interaction with you
            through interviews and would have expressed interest in hiring you,
            before requesting personal information like bank account details,
            pan card and marksheets.

            remuneration, payment mechanism, address and contact details of the
